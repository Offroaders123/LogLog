# LogLog

a poop log app!

New wacky idea I came up with today, a poop log app, where every time you have a movement (lol?), you'd tell the app you had one, and it will be a catalog of all of your history for the year.

This is more of a joke app, but kind of a neat way to explore data analysis too (I swear these puns write themselves).
